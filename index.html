                🕊 Saint Augustine of Hippo

<li>👤 Who Was St. Augustine?

St. Augustine (354–430 AD) was a bishop, theologian, philosopher, and one of the most important figures in Christianity. Known as the “Doctor of Grace,” he shaped much of Catholic teaching on sin, grace, and the love of God. His personal journey from a life of worldly pleasures to a life fully dedicated to Christ continues to inspire countless people.</li>

<li>✝ His Life

Early Life: Born in Tagaste (modern-day Algeria) to a pagan father, Patricius, and a devout Christian mother, St. Monica.

Search for Truth: In his youth, Augustine lived a worldly life and followed different philosophies, searching for meaning.

Conversion: Through the prayers of his mother and the preaching of St. Ambrose in Milan, he experienced a dramatic conversion. Reading Romans 13:13–14, he surrendered to Christ.

Priest & Bishop: Baptized in 387 AD, he later became a priest and then bishop of Hippo (North Africa), serving for 34 years.

Writings: His Confessions is a spiritual autobiography that reveals his struggles, conversion, and love of God. His City of God is a masterpiece defending the faith against pagan critics.

Death: Died in 430 AD during the siege of Hippo by the Vandals.</li>

<li>🌟 Legacy

Recognized as one of the greatest Doctors of the Church.

His writings continue to shape Christian theology, especially on grace, free will, and the nature of the Church.

Famous for his profound love of God, summed up in his words: “Our hearts are restless until they rest in You, O Lord.”</li>

Perseverance: Her years of prayer and tears were finally answered when Augustine converted after hearing St. Ambrose preach.

Death: She died peacefully in Ostia (Italy) in 387 AD, soon after witnessing Augustine’s baptism and transformation in Christ.</li>

<LI>👤 Who Was St. Polycarp?

St. Polycarp (c. 69–155 AD) was the Bishop of Smyrna (modern-day Turkey) and a disciple of St. John the Apostle. He is one of the most important Apostolic Fathers, linking the first generation of Christians (the Apostles) to the early Church.</LI>

<LI>✝ His Life

Early Formation: Tradition holds that Polycarp was directly taught by St. John the Apostle, giving him a unique closeness to the original witnesses of Christ.

Bishop of Smyrna: He served faithfully as bishop, guiding his flock with wisdom, courage, and holiness.

Defender of the Faith: Polycarp opposed heresies of his time and upheld the true teaching of Christ passed down from the Apostles.

Martyrdom: Around 155 AD, during a persecution, he was arrested and brought before Roman authorities. When ordered to deny Christ, Polycarp boldly said:

> “Eighty-six years I have served Him, and He has never wronged me. How can I blaspheme my King who saved me?”
He was sentenced to be burned alive, but tradition says the flames did not consume him, so he was finally executed by the sword.</LI>

<LI>🌟 Legacy

St. Polycarp is one of the earliest martyrs after the Apostles whose story we know in detail.

His example of courage and fidelity continues to inspire Christians facing trials.

His writings, especially his Letter to the Philippians, are treasured for their simple, strong faith.</LI>

🕊 Saint Stephen

<li>👤 Who Was St. Stephen?

St. Stephen was the first Christian martyr, known as the Protomartyr. He was one of the first deacons chosen by the Apostles to serve the early Church, and he gave his life boldly witnessing to Christ.</li>

<li>✝ His Life

Early Role: In the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 6–7), Stephen is described as a man “full of faith and the Holy Spirit.”

Deacon: The Apostles appointed him as one of seven deacons to help care for the poor and assist in ministry.

Preaching: Stephen’s wisdom and courage in preaching about Jesus drew many to the faith, but also provoked opposition from Jewish leaders.

Martyrdom: Accused of blasphemy, he was put on trial before the Sanhedrin. Stephen bravely proclaimed Christ as the Son of God, and, filled with the Holy Spirit, saw a vision of Jesus standing at the right hand of the Father. Enraged, the crowd dragged him out of the city and stoned him to death.

Final Words: Like Jesus, Stephen prayed for his persecutors, saying: “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” (Acts 7:60). Among those present was Saul, who later became St. Paul.</li>

<li>🌟 Legacy

St. Stephen is honored as the first martyr of Christianity.

His courage, forgiveness, and faith set an example for all believers.

He reminds us to remain faithful, even in trials, and to love and forgive those who oppose us.</li>

          <h3>INTRODUCTION TO MASS</h3>
         
<li>
  <div>The Mass is a sacred celebration where the Christian community gathers to worship God through prayers, readings, and the Eucharist. It is a moment of reflection, thanksgiving, and spiritual renewal, uniting believers in faith and fellowship.
</div><br>

<div>NOTE: A Mass is a structured liturgical celebration that includes the Eucharist, while a Service is a general act of worship that may not follow the liturgical format or include Holy Communion. </div></li><br>

<li>📜 Scriptural Foundations

The Last Supper (Luke 22:19–20)

The Bread of Life discourse (John 6)

The Emmaus encounter (Luke 24:30–31)

The early Church’s worship (Acts 2:42) </li><br>


<li>🕯 Two Great Parts

The Mass unfolds in two essential parts, which form one single act of worship:

📖 Liturgy of the Word

God speaks through Scripture, culminating in the proclamation of the Gospel and the homily. 

🕊 Liturgy of the Eucharist

The Church offers bread and wine, the priest consecrates them, and the faithful receive the Body and Blood of Christ.</li><br>


<li>🛑 Why the Mass Is Not a Service

A prayer service may include Scripture, hymns, and preaching—but it lacks:

A sacrificial offering

Eucharistic consecration

The Real Presence of Christ

Apostolic priesthood

The Mass is the highest form of worship because only in the Mass is Christ’s saving sacrifice made present. </li> <br>

<li>🕊 “Source and Summit”

The Church teaches:

> “The Eucharist is the source and summit of the Christian life.” (CCC 1324)

Everything in the Church flows from the Eucharist, and everything returns to it. Without the Mass, the Church loses her center, her identity, and her power.</li> <br>

<li>🌍 Heaven on Earth

At every Mass, we join:

Angels and saints

The souls in Purgatory

The entire Church on earth


> The Mass is the worship of heaven breaking into time.</li> <br>

<li>📖 Why the Mass Matters

At Mass, heaven and earth meet. We:

Listen to the Word of God

Offer our lives with the bread and wine

Receive Jesus in Holy Communion

Are strengthened to live our faith in the world </li><br>


<li>⛪ Sunday Obligation (Why We Go Every Week)

Catholics attend Mass every Sunday because God asks us to keep the Lord’s Day holy. The Church also teaches that the Eucharist is the “source and summit of the Christian life,” meaning nothing is more important or powerful for our spiritual life than the Holy Mass.</li> <br>


<li>🎨 The Liturgical Seasons

The Church year is made of sacred seasons that help us grow in faith:

Season	Color	Meaning

Advent	Purple	Preparation for Christ
Christmas	White	Joy of Christ’s birth
Lent	Purple	Repentance & conversion
Easter	White	Resurrection & victory
Ordinary Time	Green	Growth & mission</li> <br>


<li>🙏 Mass Intentions

You can offer a Mass for:

A loved one who passed away

A birthday or anniversary

Thanksgiving

Healing or special needs


This is one of the most powerful prayers you can offer for someone. </li><br>


<li>🎶 Music at Mass

Sacred music is prayer. Hymns and chants help us lift our hearts to God and enter into worship with reverence and joy. </li><br>


<li>💡 How to Participate Fully

Arrive early and pray quietly

Respond and sing with the community

Listen attentively to the readings and homily

Offer your heart during the Eucharistic prayer

Receive Communion reverently (or make a spiritual communion)</li> <br>


<li>✍ Quick FAQ

Can non-Catholics receive Communion?
No. They are welcome to attend and pray, but Communion is for those in full communion with the Catholic Church.

Do I have to go every Sunday?
Yes—unless you are sick or unable for a serious reason.

What do I do if I arrive late?
Enter quietly and join the prayer, but it is best to attend from the beginning.</li> <br>


<li>🔹 Important Note

> A Mass is a Sacrifice. A service is a prayer gathering. 



The Mass includes the consecration of bread and wine, becoming the Body and Blood of Christ.

A prayer service does NOT include the Eucharistic sacrifice. </li> <br>

<h3>THE ORDER OF MASS</h3> 

<li>Excerpts from the English translation of The Roman Missal © 2010, International Commission on English in the Liturgy Corporation. All rights reserved. </li>

<h3>The Introductory Rites </h3>

<li> <p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;"> When the people are gathered, the Priest approaches the altar with the ministers while the Entrance Chant is sung.
When he has arrived at the altar, after making a profound bow with the ministers, the Priest venerates the altar with a kiss and, if appropriate, incenses the cross and the altar. Then, with the ministers, he goes to the chair.
When the Entrance Chant is concluded, the Priest and the faithful, standing, sign themselves with the Sign of the Cross, while the Priest, facing the people, says:</p>
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The people reply:</p>
Amen. </li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;"> Then the Priest, extending his hands, greets the people, saying:</p>
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and the love of God,
and the communion of the Holy Spirit
be with you all.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Or:</p>
Grace to you and peace from God our Father
and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Or: </p>
The Lord be with you.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The people reply:</p>
And with your spirit.

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">In this first greeting a Bishop, instead of</p> The Lord be with you, says:
Peace be with you.</li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;"> The Priest, or a Deacon, or another minister, may very briefly introduce the faithful to the Mass of the day.</p>
Penitential Act* </li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Then follows the Penitential Act, to which the Priest invites the faithful, saying:</p>
Brethren <p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">(</p> and sisters<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">)</p>, let us acknowledge our sins,
and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">A brief pause for silence follows. Then all recite together the formula of general confession:</p>
I confess to almighty God
and to you, my brothers and sisters,
that I have greatly sinned,
in my thoughts and in my words,
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">And, striking their breast, they say:</p>
through my fault, through my fault,
through my most grievous fault;
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Then they continue:</p>
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,
all the Angels and Saints,
and you, my brothers and sisters,
to pray for me to the Lord our God.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The absolution by the Priest follows:</p>
May almighty God have mercy on us,
forgive us our sins,
and bring us to everlasting life.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The people reply:</p>
Amen.</li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Or:</p>
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The Priest invites the faithful to make the Penitential Act:</p>
Brethren<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;"> (</p> and sisters<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">)</p>, let us acknowledge our sins,
and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">A brief pause for silence follows.
The Priest then says:</p>
Have mercy on us, O Lord.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">he people reply:</p>
For we have sinned against you.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The Priest:</p>
Show us, O Lord, your mercy.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The people:</p>
And grant us your salvation.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The absolution by the Priest follows:</p>
May almighty God have mercy on us,
forgive us our sins,
and bring us to everlasting life.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The people reply:</p>
Amen.</li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Or:</p>
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The Priest invites the faithful to make the Penitential Act:</p>
Brethren (brothers and sisters), let us acknowledge our sins,
and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">A brief pause for silence follows.
The Priest, or a Deacon or another minister, then says the following or other invocations*</p> with Kyrie, eleison (Lord, have mercy):
You were sent to heal the contrite of heart:
Lord, have mercy. Or: Kyrie, eleison.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The people reply:</p>
Lord, have mercy. Or: Kyrie, eleison.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The Priest:</p>
You came to call sinners:
Christ, have mercy. Or: Christe, eleison.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The people reply:</p>
Christ, have mercy. Or: Christe, eleison.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The Priest:</p>
You are seated at the right hand of the Father to intercede for us:
Lord, have mercy. Or: Kyrie, eleison.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The people:</p>
Lord, have mercy. Or: Kyrie, eleison.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The absolution by the Priest follows:</p>
May almighty God have mercy on us,
forgive us our sins,
and bring us to everlasting life.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The people reply:</p>
Amen.</li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The</p> Kyrie eleison (Lord, have mercy)<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">invocations follow, unless they have just occurred in a formula of the Penitential Act.</p>
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">V.</p>, have mercy. <p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">R.</p> Lord, have mercy.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">V.</p> Christ, have mercy. <p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">R.</p> Christ, have mercy.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">V.</p> Lord, have mercy. <p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">R.</p> Lord, have mercy.
Or:
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">V.</p> Kyrie, eleison. <p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">R.</p> Kyrie, eleison.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">V.</p> Christe, eleison. <p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">R.</p> Christe, eleison.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">V.</p> Kyrie, eleison. <p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">R.</p> Kyrie, eleison.</li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Then, when it is prescribed, this hymn is either sung or said:</p>
Glory to God in the highest,
and on earth peace to people of good will.
We praise you,
we bless you,
we adore you,
we glorify you,
we give you thanks for your great glory,
Lord God, heavenly King,
O God, almighty Father.
Lord Jesus Christ, Only Begotten Son,
Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father,
you take away the sins of the world,
have mercy on us;
you take away the sins of the world,
receive our prayer;
you are seated at the right hand of the Father,
have mercy on us.
For you alone are the Holy One,
you alone are the Lord,
you alone are the Most High,
Jesus Christ,
with the Holy Spirit,
in the glory of God the Father.
Amen.</li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">When this hymn is concluded, the Priest, with hands joined, says:</p>
Let us pray.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">And all pray in silence with the Priest for a while.
Then the Priest, with hands extended, says the Collect prayer, at the end of which the people acclaim:</p>
Amen.</li>

<h3>The Liturgy of the Word</h3>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;"> Then the reader goes to the ambo and reads the First Reading, while all sit and listen.
To indicate the end of the reading, the reader acclaims:</p>
The word of the Lord.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">All reply:</p>
Thanks be to God.</li>
<li> <p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The psalmist or cantor sings or says the Psalm, with the people making the response.</li>
<li>After this, if there is to be a Second Reading, a reader reads it from the ambo, as above.
To indicate the end of the reading, the reader acclaims:</p>
The word of the Lord.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">All reply:</p>
Thanks be to God.</li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">There follows the</p> Alleluia <p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">or another chant</p> laid down by the rubrics, as the liturgical time requires.</li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Meanwhile, if incense is used, the Priest puts some into the thurible. After this, the Deacon who is to proclaim the Gospel, bowing profoundly before the Priest, asks for the blessing, saying in a low voice:</p>
Your blessing, Father.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The Priest says in a low voice:</p>
May the Lord be in your heart and on your lips,
that you may proclaim his Gospel worthily and well,
in the name of the Father and of the Son <p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">>✠</p> and of the Holy Spirit.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The Deacon signs himself with the Sign of the Cross and replies:</p>
Amen.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">If, however, a Deacon is not present, the Priest, bowing before the altar, says quietly:
Cleanse my heart and my lips, almighty God,
that I may worthily proclaim your holy Gospel.</li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The Deacon, or the Priest, then proceeds to the ambo, accompanied, if appropriate, by ministers with incense and candles. There he says:</p>
The Lord be with you.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The people reply:</p>
And with your spirit.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The Deacon, or the Priest:</p>
A reading from the holy Gospel according to <p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">N</p>.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">and, at the same time, he makes the Sign of the Cross on the book and on his forehead, lips, and breast.
The people acclaim:</p>
Glory to you, O Lord.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Then the Deacon, or the Priest, incenses the book, if incense is used, and proclaims the Gospel.</li>
<li> At the end of the Gospel, the Deacon, or the Priest, acclaims:</p>
The Gospel of the Lord.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">All reply:</p>
Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Then he kisses the book, saying quietly:</p>
Through the words of the Gospel
may our sins be wiped away.</li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Then follows the Homily, which is to be preached by a Priest or Deacon on all Sundays and Holydays of Obligation; on other days, it is recommended.</li>
<li> At the end of the Homily, the Symbol or Profession of Faith or Creed, when prescribed, is either sung or said:
An alternate musical setting of the Creed may be found in Appendix I, pp.</p> 000-000.
I believe in one God,
the Father almighty,
maker of heaven and earth,
of all things visible and invisible.
I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ,
the Only Begotten Son of God,
born of the Father before all ages.
God from God, Light from Light,
true God from true God,
begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father;
through him all things were made.
For us men and for our salvation
he came down from heaven,
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">At the words that follow up to and including</p> and became man, <p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">all bow</p>.
and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary,
and became man.
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate,
he suffered death and was buried,
and rose again on the third day
in accordance with the Scriptures.
He ascended into heaven
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
He will come again in glory
to judge the living and the dead
and his kingdom will have no end.
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,
who proceeds from the Father and the Son,
who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,
who has spoken through the prophets.
I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church.
I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins
and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead
and the life of the world to come. Amen.</li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;"></p>Instead of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, especially during Lent and Easter Time, the baptismal Symbol of the Roman Church, known as the Apostles’ Creed, may be used.</p>
I believe in God,
the Father almighty,
Creator of heaven and earth,
and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">At the words that follow, up to and including</p> the Virgin Mary, <p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">all bow.</p>
who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
born of the Virgin Mary,
suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, died and was buried;
he descended into hell;
on the third day he rose again from the dead;
he ascended into heaven,
and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty;
from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Spirit,
the holy catholic Church,
the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body,
and life everlasting. Amen.</li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Then follows the Universal Prayer, that is, the Prayer of the Faithful or Bidding Prayers.</p></li>

<h3>The Liturgy of the Eucharist</h3>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">When all this has been done, the Offertory Chant begins. Meanwhile, the ministers place the corporal, the purificator, the chalice, the pall, and the Missal on the altar.</li>
<li>It is desirable that the faithful express their participation by making an offering, bringing forward bread and wine for the celebration of the Eucharist and perhaps other gifts to relieve the needs of the Church and of the poor.</li>
<li>The Priest, standing at the altar, takes the paten with the bread and holds it slightly raised above the altar with both hands, saying in a low voice:</p>
Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation,
for through your goodness we have received
the bread we offer you:
fruit of the earth and work of human hands,
it will become for us the bread of life.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Then he places the paten with the bread on the corporal.
If, however, the Offertory Chant is not sung, the Priest may speak these words aloud; at the end, the people may acclaim:</p>
Blessed be God for ever.</li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The Deacon, or the Priest, pours wine and a little water into the chalice, saying quietly:
By the mystery of this water and wine
may we come to share in the divinity of Christ
who humbled himself to share in our humanity.</p></li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The Priest then takes the chalice and holds it slightly raised above the altar with both hands, saying in a low voice:</p>
Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation,
for through your goodness we have received
the wine we offer you:
fruit of the vine and work of human hands,
it will become our spiritual drink.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Then he places the chalice on the corporal.
If, however, the Offertory Chant is not sung, the Priest may speak these words aloud; at the end, the people may acclaim:</p>
Blessed be God for ever.</li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;"> The deacon, or the priest, pours wine and a little water into the chalice, saying quietly </p></li>
By the mysteryof this water and wine may we come to share in the divinity of Christwho humbled himself to share in our humanity.
 <li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The priest then takes the chalice and holds it slightly raissed above the alter with both hands, saying in a low voice </p></li>
 Blessed are you, lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received the wine we offer you:
 fruit of the vine and work of human hands, it will become our spiritual drink.
 <p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Then he places the chalice on the corporal.
  if however, the offertory chant is not sung, the priest may speak these word aloud; at the end, the people may acclaim:
 </p>
 Blessed be God forever.
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">After this, the Priest, bowing profoundly, says quietly:</p>
With humble spirit and contrite heart
may we be accepted by you, O Lord,
and may our sacrifice in your sight this day
be pleasing to you, Lord God.</li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">If appropriate, he also incenses the offerings, the cross, and the altar. A Deacon or other minister then incenses the Priest and the people.</li>
<li>28. Then the Priest, standing at the side of the altar, washes his hands, saying quietly:</p>
Wash me, O Lord, from my iniquity
and cleanse me from my sin.</li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Standing at the middle of the altar, facing the people, extending and then joining his hands, he says:</p>
Pray, brethren (brothers and sisters),
that my sacrifice and yours
may be acceptable to God,
the almighty Father.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The people rise and reply:</p>
May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands
for the praise and glory of his name,
for our good</li>
and the good of all his holy Church.
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Then the Priest, with hands extended, says the Prayer over the Offerings, at the end of which the people acclaim:</p>
Amen.</li>

<h3>THE EUCHARISTIC PRAYER</h3>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Then the Priest begins the Eucharistic Prayer.
Extending his hands, he says:</p>
The Lord be with you.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The people reply:</p>
And with your spirit.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The Priest, raising his hands, continues:</p>
Lift up your hearts.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The people:</p>
We lift them up to the Lord.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The Priest, with hands extended, adds:</p>
Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The people:</p>
It is right and just.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The Priest, with hands extended, continues the Preface.
At the end of the Preface he joins his hands and concludes the Preface with the people, singing or saying aloud:</p>
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
Hosanna in the highest.
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
Hosanna in the highest.</li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Or:</p>
<p style="color:red; font-size: 20px;"> 32. In all Masses, the Priest celebrant is permitted to sing parts of the Eucharistic Prayer provided with musical notation below, pp.</p> 000ff., <p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">especially the principal parts.
<div>In Eucharistic Prayer I, the Roman Canon, the words included in brackets may be omitted.</div>
<h4>THE EUCHARISTIC PRAYERS</h4></li>

<div> <h3>EUCHARISTIC PRAYER I</h3>

<li><h4>(THE ROMAN CANON)</h4>

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">R.</p> It is right and just.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Then follows the Preface to be used in accord with the rubrics, which concludes:</p>
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
Hosanna in the highest.
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
Hosanna in the highest.</li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The Priest, with hands extended, says:</p>
To you, therefore, most merciful Father,
we make humble prayer and petition
through Jesus Christ, your Son, our Lord:
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">he joins his hands and says</p>
that you accept
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">He makes the Sign of the Cross once over the bread and chalice together, saying:</p>
and bless <p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">✠</p> these gifts, these offerings,
these holy and unblemished sacrifices,
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">With hands extended, he continues:</p>
which we offer you firstly
for your holy catholic Church.
Be pleased to grant her peace,
to guard, unite and govern her
throughout the whole world,
together with your servant <p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">N</p>. our Pope

Remember, Lord, your servants <p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">N</p>. and <p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">N</p>.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The Priest joins his hands and prays briefly for those for whom he intends to pray.
Then, with hands extended, he continues:</p>
and all gathered here,
whose faith and devotion are known to you.
For them, we offer you this sacrifice of praise
or they offer it for themselves
and all who are dear to them:
for the redemption of their souls,
in hope of health and well-being,
and paying their homage to you,
the eternal God, living and true.</li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;"> Within the Action.</p>
In communion with those whose memory we venerate,

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">He shows the chalice to the people, places it on the corporal, and genuflects in adoration</p>.</li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Then he says:</p>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">He takes the chalice and the paten with the host and, raising both, he says:</p>

O God, almighty Father,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
all glory and honor is yours,
for ever and ever.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">he people acclaim:</p>

<h3>EUCHARISTIC PRAYER II</h3>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;"> Although it is provided with its own Preface, this Eucharistic Prayer may also be used with other Prefaces, especially those that present an overall view of the mystery of salvation, such as the Common Prefaces.</p>
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">V.</p> The Lord be with you.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">R.</p> And with your spirit.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">V.</p> Lift up your hearts.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">R.</p> We lift them up to the Lord.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">V.</p> Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">R.</p> It is right and just.
It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks, Father most holy,
through your beloved Son, Jesus Christ,
your Word through whom you made all things,
whom you sent as our Savior and Redeemer,
incarnate by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin.
Fulfilling your will and gaining for you a holy people,
he stretched out his hands as he endured his Passion,
so as to break the bonds of death and manifest the resurrection.
And so, with the Angels and all the Saints
we declare your glory,
as with one voice we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
Hosanna in the highest.
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
Hosanna in the highest.</li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;"> The Priest, with hands extended, says:</p>
You are indeed Holy, O Lord,
the fount of all holiness.
 <p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">He joins his hands and, holding them extended over the offerings, says:</p>
Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray,
by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall,
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">He joins his hands
and makes the Sign of the Cross once over the bread and the chalice together, saying:</p>
so that they may become for us
the Body and <p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">✠</p> Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">He joins his hands</p>.</li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">In the formulas that follow, the words of the Lord should be pronounced clearly and distinctly, as the nature of these words requires.</p>
At the time he was betrayed
and entered willingly into his Passion,
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">He takes the bread
and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues:</p>
he took bread and, giving thanks, broke it,
and gave it to his disciples, saying:
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">He bows slightly</p>.
<h5>TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND EAT OF IT,
FOR THIS IS MY BODY,
WHICH WILL BE GIVEN UP FOR YOU.</h5>
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">He shows the consecrated host to the people, places it again on the paten, and genuflects in adoration.</p>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">After this, he continues:</p>
In a similar way, when supper was ended,
He takes the chalice
and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues:
he took the chalice
and, once more giving thanks,
he gave it to his disciples, saying:
He bows slightly.
<h5>TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND DRINK FROM IT,
FOR THIS IS THE CHALICE OF MY BLOOD,
THE BLOOD OF THE NEW AND ETERNAL COVENANT,
WHICH WILL BE POURED OUT FOR YOU AND FOR MANY
FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS.
DO THIS IN MEMORY OF ME. </h5>
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">He shows the chalice to the people, places it on the corporal, and genuflects in adoration.</p></li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Then he says:</p>
The mystery of faith.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">And the people continue, acclaiming:</p>
We proclaim your Death, O Lord,
and profess your Resurrection
until you come again.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Or:</p>
When we eat this Bread and drink this Cup,
we proclaim your Death, O Lord,
until you come again.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Or:</p>
Save us, Savior of the world,
for by your Cross and Resurrection
you have set us free. </li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Then the Priest, with hands extended, says:</p>
Therefore, as we celebrate
the memorial of his Death and Resurrection,
we offer you, Lord,
the Bread of life and the Chalice of salvation,
giving thanks that you have held us worthy
to be in your presence and minister to you.
Humbly we pray
that, partaking of the Body and Blood of Christ,
we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit.
Remember, Lord, your Church,
spread throughout the world,
and bring her to the fullness of charity,
together with <p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">N</p>. our Pope and <p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">N</p>. our Bishop*
and all the clergy.

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">In Masses for the Dead, the following may be added:</p>
Remember your servant <p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">N</p>.,
whom you have called (today)
from this world to yourself.
Grant that he (she) who was united with your Son in a death like his,
may also be one with him in his Resurrection.

Remember also our brothers and sisters
who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection,
and all who have died in your mercy:
welcome them into the light of your face.
Have mercy on us all, we pray,
that with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God,
with blessed Joseph, her Spouse,
with the blessed Apostles,
and all the Saints who have pleased you throughout the ages,
we may merit to be coheirs to eternal life,
and may praise and glorify you
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">He joins his hands.</p>
through your Son, Jesus Christ. </li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">He takes the chalice and the paten with the host and, raising both, he says:</p>
Through him, and with him, and in him,
O God, almighty Father,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
all glory and honor is yours,
for ever and ever.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">The people acclaim:</p>
        Amen
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">Then follows the Communion Rite, p.</p> 000.</li>

<h3>EUCHARISTIC PRAYER III </h3>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;"> V.</p> The Lord be with you.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">R.</p> And with your spirit.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2o;">V.</p> Lift up your hearts.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">R.</p> We lift them up to the Lord.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">V.</p> Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">R.</p> It is right and just.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">Then follows the Preface to be used in accord with the rubrics, which concludes:</p>
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
Hosanna in the highest.
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
Hosanna in the highest.</li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">The Priest, with hands extended, says:</p>
You are indeed Holy, O Lord,
and all you have created rightly gives you praise, for through your Son our Lord Jesus Christ, by the power and working of the Holy Spirit,
you give life to all things and make them holy, and you never cease to gather a people to yourself, so that from the rising of the sun to its setting
a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name.</li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;"> He joins his hands and, holding them extended over the offerings, says:</p>
Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you:
by the same Spirit graciously make holy
these gifts we have brought to you for consecration,
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">He joins his hands
and makes the Sign of the Cross once over the bread and chalice together, saying:</p>
that they may become the Body and <p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">✠</p> Blood
of your Son our Lord Jesus Christ,
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">He joins his hands.</p>
at whose command we celebrate these mysteries.</li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">In the formulas that follow, the words of the Lord should be pronounced clearly and distinctly, as the nature of these words requires</p>.
For on the night he was betrayed
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">He takes the bread
and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues:</p>
he himself took bread,
and, giving you thanks, he said the blessing,
broke the bread and gave it to his disciples, saying:
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">He bows slightly.</p>
<h5>TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND EAT OF IT,
FOR THIS IS MY BODY,
WHICH WILL BE GIVEN UP FOR YOU. </h5>
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">He shows the consecrated host to the people, places it again on the paten, and genuflects in adoration.</p></li>
<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;"> After this, he continues:</p>
In a similar way, when supper was ended,
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">He takes the chalice
and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues:</p>
he took the chalice,
and, giving you thanks, he said the blessing,
and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying:
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">He bows slightly.</p>
<h5>TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND DRINK FROM IT,

DO THIS IN MEMORY OF ME.</h5>
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">He shows the chalice to the people, places it on the corporal, and genuflects in adoration.</p>

<p style="color: red;font-size: 2px;"> Then he says</p>
The mystery of faith.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">And the people continue, acclaiming:</p>
We proclaim your Death, O Lord,
and profess your Resurrection
until you come again.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">or:</p>
When we eat this Bread and drink this Cup,
we proclaim your Death, O Lord,
until you come again.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">or:</p>
Save us, Savior of the world,
for by your Cross and Resurrection
you have set us free.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">Then the Priest, with hands extended, says:</p>
Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the saving Passion of your Son,
his wondrous Resurrection and Ascension into heaven, and as we look forward to his second coming, we offer you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice.
Look, we pray, upon the oblation of your Church and, recognizing the sacrificial Victim by whose death
you willed to reconcile us to yourself,
grant that we, who are nourished by the Body and Blood of your Son and filled with his Holy Spirit, may become one body, one spirit in Christ.
May he make of us
an eternal offering to you,
so that we may obtain an inheritance with your elect,
with the most Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God,
with blessed Joseph, her Spouse,
with your blessed Apostles and glorious Martyrs
(with Saint <p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">N</p>.: the Saint of the day or Patron Saint)
and with all the Saints,
on whose constant intercession in your presence we rely for unfailing help.
May this Sacrifice of our reconciliation,
we pray, O Lord, advance the peace and salvation of all the world. Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity your pilgrim Church on earth,
with your servant <p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">N</p>. our Pope and <p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">N</p>. our Bishop,<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">*</p>
the Order of Bishops, all the clergy,
and the entire people you have gained for your own.
Listen graciously to the prayers of this family,
whom you have summoned before you:
in your compassion, O merciful Father, gather to yourself all your children scattered throughout the world.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">†</p> To our departed brothers and sisters
and to all who were pleasing to you
at their passing from this life,
give kind admittance to your kingdom.
There we hope to enjoy for ever the fullness of your glory
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">He joins his hands.</p>
through Christ our Lord,
through whom you bestow on the world all that is good. <p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">†</p>
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">He takes the chalice and the paten with the host and, raising both, he says:</p>
Through him, and with him, and in him,
O God, almighty Father,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
all glory and honor is yours,
for ever and ever.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">The people acclaim:</p>
Amen.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">Then follows the Communion Rite, p.</p> 000.

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">When this Eucharistic Prayer is used in Masses for the Dead, the following may be said:</p>
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">†</p> Remember your servant <p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">N.</p>
whom you have called (today)
from this world to yourself.
Grant that he (she) who was united with your Son in a death like his,

also be one with him in his Resurrection,
when from the earth
he will raise up in the flesh those who have died,
and transform our lowly body after the pattern of his own glorious body. To our departed brothers and sisters, too, and to all who were pleasing to you at their passing from this life,
give kind admittance to your kingdom. There we hope to enjoy for ever the fullness of your glory, when you will wipe away every tear from our eyes.
For seeing you, our God, as you are, we shall be like you for all the ages and praise you without end,
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">He joins his hands.</p>
through Christ our Lord, through whom you bestow on the world all that is good. <p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">†</p></li>
<h3>EUCHARISTIC PRAYER IV </h3>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;"> It is not permitted to change the Preface of this Eucharistic Prayer because of the structure of the Prayer itself, which presents a summary of the history of salvation.</p>

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">V</p>. The Lord be with you 
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">R</p>. And with your Spirit 
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">V</p>. Lift up your hearts 
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">R</p>. We lift them up to the Lord 
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">V</p>. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God 
<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">R</p>. It is right and just
It is truly right to give you thanks, 

truly just to give you glory, Father most holy, 

for you are the one God living and true, 

existing before all ages and abiding for all eternity, 

dwelling in unapproachable light; 

yet you, who alone are good, the source of life, 

have made all that is, 

so that you might fill your creatures with blessings 

and bring joy to many of them by the glory of your light. 

And so, in your presence are countless hosts of Angels, 

who serve you day and night 

and, gazing upon the glory of your face, 

glorify you without ceasing. 
With them we, too, confess your name in exultation, 
giving voice to every creature under heaven, 
as we acclaim: 
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts. 
Heaven and earth are full of your glory. 
Hosanna in the highest. 
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. 
Hosanna in the highest.</li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">The Priest, with hands extended, says: </p>

We give you praise, Father most holy, 

for you are great 

and you have fashioned all your works 

in wisdom and in love. 

You formed man in your own image 

and entrusted the whole world to his care, 

so that in serving you alone, the Creator, 

he might have dominion over all creatures. 

And when through disobedience he had lost your friendship, 

you did not abandon him to the domain of death. 

For you came in mercy to the aid of all, 

so that those who seek might find you. 

Time and again you offered them covenants 

and through the prophets 

taught them to look forward to salvation. 

And you so loved the world, Father most holy, 

that in the fullness of time 

you sent your Only Begotten Son to be our Savior. 

Made incarnate by the Holy Spirit 

and born of the Virgin Mary, 

he shared our human nature 

in all things but sin. 

To the poor he proclaimed the good news of salvation, 

to prisoners, freedom, 

and to the sorrowful of heart, joy. 

To accomplish your plan, 

he gave himself up to death, 

and, rising from the dead, 

he destroyed death and restored life. 

And that we might live no longer for ourselves 

but for him who died and rose again for us, 

he sent the Holy Spirit from you, Father, 

as the first fruits for those who believe, 

so that, bringing to perfection his work in the world, 

he might sanctify creation to the full.</li> 

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">He joins his hands and, holding them extended over the offerings, says: </p>

Therefore, O Lord, we pray: 

may this same Holy Spirit 

graciously sanctify these offerings, 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">He joins his hands 

and makes the Sign of the Cross once over the bread and chalice together, saying: </p>

that they may become 

the Body and <p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">✠</p> Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">He joins his hands.</p> 

for the celebration of this great mystery, 

which he himself left us 

as an eternal covenant.</li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;"> In the formulas that follow, the words of the Lord should be pronounced clearly and distinctly, as the nature of these words requires. </p>

For when the hour had come 

for him to be glorified by you, Father most holy, 

having loved his own who were in the world, 

he loved them to the end: 

and while they were at supper, 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">He takes the bread 

and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues: </p>

he took bread, blessed and broke it, 

and gave it to his disciples, saying, 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">He bows slightly.</p>

<h5>TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND EAT OF IT, 

FOR THIS IS MY BODY, 

WHICH WILL BE GIVEN UP FOR YOU. </h5>

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">He shows the consecrated host to the people, places it again on the paten, and genuflects in adoration.</p> </li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">After this, he continues: </p>

In a similar way, 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">He takes the chalice 

and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues:</p>

taking the chalice filled with the fruit of the vine, 

he gave thanks, 

and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying: 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">He bows slightly. </p>

<h5>TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND DRINK FROM IT, 

FOR THIS IS THE CHALICE OF MY BLOOD, 

THE BLOOD OF THE NEW AND ETERNAL COVENANT, 

WHICH WILL BE POURED OUT FOR YOU AND FOR MANY 

FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS. 

DO THIS IN MEMORY OF ME.</h5>

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">He shows the chalice to the people, places it on the corporal, and genuflects in adoration.</p></li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">Then he says: </p>

The mystery of faith. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">And the people continue, acclaiming:</p> 

We proclaim your Death, O Lord, 

and profess your Resurrection 

until you come again. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">Or:</p> 

When we eat this Bread and drink this Cup, 

we proclaim your Death, O Lord, 

until you come again. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">Or:</p>

Save us, Savior of the world, 

for by your Cross and Resurrection 

you have set us free.</li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">Then, with hands extended, the Priest says:</p> 

Therefore, O Lord, 

as we now celebrate the memorial of our redemption, 

we remember Christ’s Death 

and his descent to the realm of the dead, 

we proclaim his Resurrection 

and his Ascension to your right hand, 

and, as we await his coming in glory, 

we offer you his Body and Blood, 

the sacrifice acceptable to you 

which brings salvation to the whole world. 

Look, O Lord, upon the Sacrifice 

which you yourself have provided for your Church, 

and grant in your loving kindness 

to all who partake of this one Bread and one Chalice 

that, gathered into one body by the Holy Spirit, 

they may truly become a living sacrifice in Christ 

to the praise of your glory. 

Therefore, Lord, remember now 

all for whom we offer this sacrifice: 

especially your servant <p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">N</p>. our Pope, 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">N</p>. our Bishop,* and the whole Order of Bishops, 

all the clergy, 

those who take part in this offering, 

those gathered here before you, 

your entire people, 

and all who seek you with a sincere heart. 

Remember also 

those who have died in the peace of your Christ 

and all the dead, 

whose faith you alone have known. 

To all of us, your children, 

grant, O merciful Father, 

that we may enter into a heavenly inheritance 

with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, 

with blessed Joseph, her Spouse, 

and with your Apostles and Saints in your kingdom. 

There, with the whole of creation, 

freed from the corruption of sin and death, 

may we glorify you through Christ our Lord, 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">He joins his hands.</p> 

through whom you bestow on the world all that is good.</li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;"> He takes the chalice and the paten with the host and, raising both, he says: </p>

Through him, and with him, and in him, 

O God, almighty Father, 

in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 

all glory and honor is yours, 

for ever and ever. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">The people acclaim:</p> 

Amen. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">Then follows the Communion Rite, p</p>. 000. </li>

<h3>The Communion Rite</h3>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">After the chalice and paten have been set down, the Priest, with hands joined, says: </p>

At the Savior’s command 

and formed by divine teaching, 

we dare to say: 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">He extends his hands and, together with the people, continues: </p>

Our Father, who art in heaven, 

hallowed be thy name; 

thy kingdom come, 

thy will be done 

on earth as it is in heaven. 

Give us this day our daily bread, 

and forgive us our trespasses, 

as we forgive those who trespass against us; 

and lead us not into temptation, 

but deliver us from evil. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">Or:</p>

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">Alternate musical settings of the Lord’s Prayer may be found in Appendix I, pp</p>. 000-000.</li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">With hands extended, the Priest alone continues, saying: </p>

Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil, 

graciously grant peace in our days, 

that, by the help of your mercy, 

we may be always free from sin 

and safe from all distress, 

as we await the blessed hope 

and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">He joins his hands. 

The people conclude the prayer, acclaiming: </p>

For the kingdom, 

the power and the glory are yours 

now and for ever.</li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">Then the Priest, with hands extended, says aloud: </p>

Lord Jesus Christ, 

who said to your Apostles: 

Peace I leave you, my peace I give you; 

look not on our sins, 

but on the faith of your Church, 

and graciously grant her peace and unity 

in accordance with your will. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">He joins his hands.</p> 

Who live and reign for ever and ever. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">The people reply:</p> 

Amen.</li>

<li> The Priest, turned towards the people, extending and then joining his hands, adds: 

The peace of the Lord be with you always. 

The people reply: 

And with your spirit.</li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">Then, if appropriate, the Deacon, or the Priest, adds: </p>

Let us offer each other the sign of peace. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">And all offer one another a sign, in keeping with local customs, that expresses peace, communion, and charity. The Priest gives the sign of peace to a Deacon or minister.</p></li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">Then he takes the host, breaks it over the paten, and places a small piece in the chalice, saying quietly:</p>

May this mingling of the Body and Blood 

of our Lord Jesus Christ 

bring eternal life to us who receive it.</li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">Meanwhile the following is sung or said: </p>

Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, 

have mercy on us. 

Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, 

have mercy on us. 

Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, 

grant us peace. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">Or:

The invocation may even be repeated several times if the fraction is prolonged. Only the final time, however, is</p> us peace<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">said</p>.</li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">Then the Priest, with hands joined, says quietly:</p> 

Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, 

who, by the will of the Father 

and the work of the Holy Spirit, 

through your Death gave life to the world, 

free me by this, your most holy Body and Blood, 

from all my sins and from every evil; 

keep me always faithful to your commandments, 

and never let me be parted from you. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">Or:</p> 

May the receiving of your Body and Blood, 

Lord Jesus Christ, 

not bring me to judgment and condemnation, 

but through your loving mercy 

be for me protection in mind and body 

and a healing remedy.</li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;"> The Priest genuflects, takes the host and, holding it slightly raised above the paten or above the chalice, while facing the people, says aloud: </p>

Behold the Lamb of God, 

behold him who takes away the sins of the world. 

Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">And together with the people he adds once:</p> 

Lord, I am not worthy 

that you should enter under my roof, 

but only say the word 

and my soul shall be healed.</li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">The Priest, facing the altar, says quietly:</p>

May the Body of Christ 

keep me safe for eternal life. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">And he reverently consumes the Body of Christ. 

Then he takes the chalice and says quietly:</p>

May the Blood of Christ 

keep me safe for eternal life. 

And he reverently consumes the Blood of Christ.</li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">After this, he takes the paten or ciborium and approaches the communicants. The Priest raises a host slightly and shows it to each of the communicants, saying: </p>

The Body of Christ. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">The communicant replies:</p> 

Amen. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">And receives Holy Communion. 

If a Deacon also distributes Holy Communion, he does so in the same manner.</p></li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">If any are present who are to receive Holy Communion under both kinds, the rite described in the proper place is to be followed.</p></li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">While the Priest is receiving the Body of Christ, the Communion Chant begins.</p></li> 

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">When the distribution of Communion is over, the Priest or a Deacon or an acolyte purifies the paten over the chalice and also the chalice itself. 

While he carries out the purification, the Priest says quietly: </p>

What has passed our lips as food, O Lord, 

may we possess in purity of heart, 

that what has been given to us in time 

may be our healing for eternity. </li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">Then the Priest may return to the chair. If appropriate, a sacred silence may be observed for a while, or a psalm or other canticle of praise or a hymn may be sung.</p></li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">Then, standing at the altar or at the chair and facing the people, with hands joined, the Priest says: </p>

Let us pray. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">All pray in silence with the Priest for a while, unless silence has just been observed. Then the Priest, with hands extended, says the Prayer after Communion, at the end of which the people acclaim:</p> 

Amen.</li> 

<h3>The Concluding Rites</h3>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;"> If they are necessary, any brief announcements to the people follow here. </p>

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;"> Then the dismissal takes place. The Priest, facing the people and extending his hands, says:</p> </li>

<li>The Lord be with you. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">The people reply:</p> 

And with your spirit. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">The Priest blesses the people, saying:</p> 

May almighty God bless you, 

the Father, and the Son, <p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">✠</p> and the Holy Spirit. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">The people reply:</p> 

Amen.</li>


<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;"> On certain days or occasions, this formula of blessing is preceded, in accordance with the rubrics, by another more solemn formula of blessing or by a prayer over the people (cf. pp.</p> 000ff.)</li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">In a Pontifical Mass, the celebrant receives the miter and, extending his hands, says:</p>

The Lord be with you. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">All reply</p>: 

And with your spirit. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">The celebrant says:</p> 

Blessed be the name of the Lord. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">All reply:</p> 

Now and for ever. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">The celebrant says: </p>

Our help is in the name of the Lord. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">All reply:</p> 

Who made heaven and earth. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">Then the celebrant receives the pastoral staff, if he uses it, and says:</p> 

May almighty God bless you, 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">making the Sign of the Cross over the people three times, he adds:</p> 

the Father, ✠ and the Son, ✠ and the Holy <p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">✠</p> Spirit. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">All:</p> 

Amen.</li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;"> Then the Deacon, or the Priest himself, with hands joined and facing the people, says: </p>

Go forth, the Mass is ended. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">Or</p>: 

Go and announce the Gospel of the Lord. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">Or</p>: 

Go in peace, glorifying the Lord by your life. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">Or</p>: 

Go in peace. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">The people reply:</p> 

Thanks be to God.</li>

<li><p style="color: red; font-size: 2opx;">Then the Priest venerates the altar as usual with a kiss, as at the beginning. After making a profound bow with the ministers, he withdraws.</p></li>

<li><div><p style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">If any liturgical action follows immediately, the rites of dismissal are omitted.</p></div></li>

      <h3>THE CATHOLIC FAITH ✝</h3>

<ul>

<li><h5>✨ Introduction:</h5>

<P>What We Believe

The Catholic Faith is not just a religion — it is a living relationship with God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It is built on Sacred Scripture, Sacred Tradition, and guided by the teaching authority of the Church (the Magisterium).
We believe that Jesus Christ founded the Catholic Church, and through the sacraments, prayer, and charity, He continues to lead, heal, and save His people today.</P></li><br>

<li><p><h5>📜 Core Catholic Beliefs</h5>

One God in Three Persons (The Trinity)

Jesus Christ is true God and true Man

The Bible is the inspired Word of God

The Church is the Body of Christ

Salvation is through Christ alone

The Seven Sacraments are channels of grace

The Eucharist is truly the Body and Blood of Christ

We believe in Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory

Mary and the Saints intercede for us

Faith must be lived in charity and truth </p></li> <br>

<li><p><h5>🕊 The Sacraments</h5>

Sacraments are outward signs instituted by Christ that give grace.

Baptism

Confirmation

Eucharist (Holy Communion)

Reconciliation (Confession)

Anointing of the Sick

Holy Orders

Matrimony

They are not symbols, they are encounters with Jesus Himself.</p></li><br>

<li><p><h5>📖 Faith FAQ: Real Answers for Real Questions</h5>

<li>❓ Do Catholics worship Mary?

No. Catholics do not worship Mary. We honor her as the Mother of God and ask for her prayers. Worship belongs to God alone. Mary always points to Jesus.</li>

<li>❓ Why do Catholics pray to saints?

We do not pray to saints as Gods, we ask them to pray for us. Just like you ask a friend to pray for you, we ask those already united with God in heaven.

“The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.” James 5:16</li>

<LI>❓ What is the Rosary?

The Rosary is a Scripture-based meditation on the life of Jesus through the eyes of Mary. It is one of the most powerful prayers in the Church for conversion, protection, and peace.</LI>

<li>❓ What is Purgatory?

Purgatory is a temporary state of purification for souls who die in God’s grace but still need purification before entering Heaven.
It is not a second chance, only the saved go there. It is God’s mercy cleansing us fully for eternal joy.</li>

<li>❓ Why confess to a priest?

Jesus gave the apostles authority to forgive sins (John 20:21–23). Priests continue that ministry. In Confession, we meet Christ, speak our sins, and receive His forgiveness.</li>

<li>❓ Why does the Church teach that the Eucharist is Jesus?

Because Jesus said:

“This is My Body, This is My Blood.”
“Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, you have no life in you.”  John 6

It is not a symbol. It is the Real Presence, Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Jesus Christ.</li>

<li>❓ Why do Catholics use statues?

Statues and images help us remember holy people and events. We do not worship them. They are like family photos — reminders of those we love.</li>

<li>❓ Is the Catholic Church Biblical?

Yes. The Catholic Church compiled the Bible, preserved it, and interprets it through the Holy Spirit. Catholic teaching is rooted deeply in Scripture and the early Church.</p></li><br>

<li><p><h5>🙏 Mary: Who She Really Is</h5>

Mother of Jesus

First Christian disciple

Full of grace from conception

Ever-Virgin

Assumed into Heaven

Given to us as our spiritual Mother

We honor Mary because Jesus honored her first.</p></li>

<li><p><h5>📌 Saints: Our Heavenly Family</h5>

Saints are ordinary people who lived extraordinary holiness. They fought against sin, loved God, served others, and now pray for the Church from heaven.
The goal of Catholic life is not just to be good, it is to become a saint.</p></li>

<li><p><h5>🌍 The Afterlife </h5>

Heaven — Eternal union with God

Hell — Eternal separation from God

Purgatory — Temporary purification in God’s love

We pray for the dead because love does not end at death.</p></li>

<li><p><h5>✨ Faith & Reason</h5>

The Catholic Church teaches that faith and reason are not enemies, they work together. True science, philosophy, and theology all lead to the same truth: God.</p></li>

<li><p><h5>📘 Mini Catechism</h5>

Who made me?
God made me.
Why did God make me?
To know Him, love Him, and serve Him in this life and be happy with Him forever in heaven.
What is the purpose of life?
To love God above all things and love our neighbor as ourselves.
What is sin?
Sin is a choice against God’s love and His law.
Who saves us?
Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world.</p></li>

<li><p><h5>🔥 How to Grow in Faith</h5>

Daily prayer

Reading Scripture

Receiving the Sacraments

Studying the Catholic faith

Serving others

Loving God above all</p></li>

<li><p><h5>💬 Final Encouragement</h5>

Faith is a journey. You don’t need to know everything to begin — you just need an open heart. Ask questions, seek truth, and trust that God will guide you.

“Seek and you will find.” – Jesus (Matthew 7:7)</p></li>
